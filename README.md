# cowin-slot-tracker
Track Cowin slots for help in vaccination slot booking using Co-WIN Public APIs to find appointment availability and to download vaccination certificates. These APIs are available for use by all third party applications. The appointment availability data is cached and may be up to 30 minutes old. Further, these APIs are subject to a rate limit of 100 API calls per 5 minutes per IP (as on May 11, 2021). Please consider these points while using the APIs in your application.
